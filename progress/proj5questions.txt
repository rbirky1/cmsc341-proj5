Purpose of join() method?
Booleans not working?
Does the buffer have code in ints run method?
Do we need to write our own insertion sort?
Why a for loop in the last example?
Processor is a thread?
Buffer2 in Receiver class must be a buffer object?
Receiver thread returns a buffer?
Why does the buffer need the N value?
Processor's run method does sort then image saving, while printing info, or is that actually in main?
file path?  will it know...?

follow example number 3

Make sat thread sleep until more space
actually add outside while loop

can send data to merge sort in consumer

check that you have n^2 items
 isPrime => merge sort
	fifth file

split data in half (find center)
creates many threads, joined later
process for left and right side, given merge sort class/function
invokeAll(l,r) execute next statement after given threads are done
or
start() / join()  -OR- compute() / join() 
when size T, call insertion sort

implement merge function takes two data elemts and combine in sorted way

.join() waits for a process to finish (done in driver)

Main
|	|	|	|
b	p	c	

don't exit until done
call .join(), then can exit
